<p>Took a bit of a gamble today, ended up quitting my long-term sponsor, Macneil Bikes.</p> 

The decision has been messing with my head for a while, but I figured it was about time. There's gotta be some sort of motivational quote that ties BMX and development together really well somewhere out there, but I haven't found it yet. Guess the moral of the story is: work on what you really want to work on, and that's it. Everyhting else will fall into or out of place on it's own. Just focus on what puts a stupid smile on your face. Life can't suck if you're always doing that, right?
